# Hackathon Dashboard Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Successfully Implemented!

I've successfully created a separate dashboard system for hackathon-only participants. Here's what has been implemented:

## ✅ Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **User Model**: Added `participantType` field with values `'bootcamp'` or `'hackathon'`
- **Migration Script**: All existing participants set to `'bootcamp'` type
- **Score Calculation**: Hackathon participants always have `totalScore: 0`

### 2. New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/hackathon/dashboard` - Get hackathon dashboard data
- `GET /api/hackathon/mentors` - Get mentors for hackathon participants
- `GET /api/hackathon/teams` - Get teams with hackathon filtering
- `GET /api/hackathon/problem-statements` - Get problem statements

### 3. Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- `PATCH /api/users/:id/participant-type` - Update participant type (Admin only)
- Updated user endpoints to support `participantType` filtering
- Enhanced dashboard stats to show participant type breakdown

### 4. Authentication Updates
- Registration now supports `participantType` selection
- Login automatically routes users to appropriate dashboard

## ✅ Frontend Implementation

### 1. Separate Hackathon Dashboard
- **HackathonDashboard.jsx**: Main dashboard component
- **Routing**: Automatic redirection based on `user.participantType`
- **Theme Integration**: Uses existing theme system

### 2. Hackathon-Specific Views
- **HackathonHomeView**: Overview with quick stats and actions
- **HackathonTeamsView**: Team creation, joining, and management
- **HackathonMentorsView**: Browse and connect with mentors
- **HackathonProblemsView**: Explore problem statements
- **HackathonProfileView**: Profile management

### 3. Registration Enhancement
- Added participant type selection dropdown
- Clear descriptions of what each type includes
- Visual indicators for hackathon vs bootcamp participants

## 🔧 Key Features
